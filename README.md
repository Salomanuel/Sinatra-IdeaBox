# IdeaBox

a system to record good, bad and awful ideas, just an excuse to:


* lay out a Sinatra application
* define routes/endpoints for that application
* use view templates to render HTML
* store data across requests with `YAML::Store`
* write a simple HTML form
* read and react to HTTP parameters from the form
* explain the statelessness of the HTTP request/response cycle
